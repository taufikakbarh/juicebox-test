# 🚀 Run This App Using `serve`
No build process is required. Simply run a local server using **serve**.

---

## 📦 1. Install Serve (if you haven't yet)
```bash
npm install -g serve
```

## 🚀 2. Start the Server
```bash
serve .
```

## P.S
I realized a bit late that the test folder includes a PDF outlining that the build should be done using **Next.js**. I initially assumed the goal was to demonstrate core fundamentals in **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, so I completed the project using vanilla front-end code.

If needed, I can rebuild this in **Next.js** to match the intended stack and folder structure.

Let me know if you’d like me to proceed with the Next.js version.
